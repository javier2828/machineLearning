Upload a file on blackboard called answers.pdf where you will type your written answers and provide the plots or values requested. The running script should be named script_nearest.mat (or script_nearest.py) that will run and test your nearest neighbor algorithm.

 

 You have to write a script that implements k-nearest neighbor classification.

    The first argument will specify the training file, where the training data is stored.
    The second argument will specify the test file, where the test data is stored.
    The third argument specifies the value of k for the k-nearest neighbor classifier.

Training Phase

During training:

    Each dimension should be normalized, separately from all other dimensions. Specifically, for both training and test objects, each dimension should be transformed using function F(v) = (v - mean) / stdev, using the mean and stdev of the values of that dimension on the training file.
    Use the Euclidean distance for computing the nearest neighbors.

Report your classification accuracy for different values of k. Report the classification accuracy in answers.pdf

 

Here are a few details about the training and testing files:

 

    USPS handwritten digits: Each row of the training file contains 17 numbers. The first 16 correspond to features extracted from a digital image of a handwritten digit. The last column is the label which indicates what digit the first 16 numbers represent. There are 10 different classes.
